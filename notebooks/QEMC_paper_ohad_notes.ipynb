    "1. \"Quantum computing provides <s style=\"color: red\">**the**</s> hope for an efficient computation scheme, much beyond the standard classical scheme\".\n",
    "2. \"In particular, it requires N qubits for solving the MaxCut problem of a<u style=\"color: green\">**n**</u> N-nodes graph\".\n",
    "3. \"Last<s style=\"color: red\">**e**</s>ly, a quantum method utilizing log(n) qubits was introduced in [16][17]\".\n",

    "1. \"The MaxCut problem is a<u style=\"color: green\">**n**</u> NP-hard [18] combinatorial problem\".\n",
    "2. \"Let $G = (V, E)$ be a (weighted) graph with nodes $V$ and (weighted) edges $E$<u style=\"color: green\">**,**</u> then finding the MaxCut amounts to partition the nodes <u style=\"color: green\">**in**</u>to two distinct subsets\".\n",

    "5. \"This decline is due to our limited quantum computing resources: first, the number of iteration is limited. For example, for the 32-node graph we had only 54 iterations on average, whereas the noiseless simulation used 300 iterations\" - What do you mean by \"We had only 54 iterations\"?\n",
