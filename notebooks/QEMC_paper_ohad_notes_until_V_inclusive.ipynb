    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Our method uses a novel information encoding scheme that requires log N qubits to address N-node<u style=\"color: green\">**s**</u> graphs\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section $I$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Quantum computing provides <s style=\"color: red\">**the**</s> hope for an efficient computation scheme, much beyond the standard classical scheme\".\n",
    "2. \"In particular, it requires N qubits for solving the MaxCut problem of a<u style=\"color: green\">**n**</u> N-nodes graph\".\n",
    "3. \"Last<s style=\"color: red\">**e**</s>ly, a quantum method utilizing log(n) qubits was introduced in [16][17]\".\n",
    "4. \"Sec. VI<s style=\"color: red\">**I**</s> discusses the efficiency of\" - I think.\n",

    "## FIG. 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A dot is missing in the end of the description.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section $II$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"The MaxCut problem is a<u style=\"color: green\">**n**</u> NP-hard [18] combinatorial problem\".\n",
    "2. \"Let $G = (V, E)$ be a (weighted) graph with nodes $V$ and (weighted) edges $E$<u style=\"color: green\">**,**</u> then finding the MaxCut amounts to partition the nodes <u style=\"color: green\">**in**</u>to two distinct subsets\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section $III$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"The QEMC maps each graph’s node k into the corresponding computational basis <u style=\"color: green\">**state**</u> $|k\\rangle$\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section $IV$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subsection $IV$-A\n",
    "1. \"whose application on problem-<s style=\"color: red\">**depended**</s><u style=\"color: green\">**dependent**</u> ansatze is not straightforward\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subsection $IV$-B\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"The rest of the graphs, i.e. those with 24-32 nodes, were generated randomly <s style=\"color: red\">through</s><u style=\"color: green\">using</u> the Networkx package\".\n",
    "2. \"As an elaborated example, we focus on the 8-node<u style=\"color: green\">s</u> graph of [8]\".\n",
    "3. \"<s style=\"color: red\">IN</s><u style=\"color: green\">In</u> particular, the average noiseless QEMC simulation is shown to outperform the average GW results for all <s style=\"color: red\">graphs’ instances</s><u style=\"color: green\">the graph-instances</u>\".\n",
    "4. \"It is also seen that the average real-hardware reach the optimal cuts for both the 4<s style=\"color: red\">-</s> and 8-nodes graphs\".\n",
    "5. \"This decline is due to our limited quantum computing resources: first, the number of iteration is limited. For example, for the 32-node graph we had only 54 iterations on average, whereas the noiseless simulation used 300 iterations\" - What do you mean by \"We had only 54 iterations\"?\n",
    "6. \"second, as the number of qubits grow<u style=\"color: green\">s</u>, more layers are needed\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subsection $IV$-C\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"where the Max QEMC curve (<s style=\"color: red\">blue</s><u style=\"color: green\">red</u>) converges faster\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section $V$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Title - \"COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCE<u style=\"color: green\">S</u> ESTIMATION\".\n",
    "2. Formally, $E$ is the set of edges, and $|E|$ is the cardinality of $E$, that is the number of edges.\n",
    "3. <s style=\"color: red\">\"(the calculation of the state’s probability distribution is upper bounded by the number of nodes N which is further upper bounded by E, assuming that the graph is connected)\"</s><u style=\"color: green\">\"(calculating $Eq. 3$ is upper-bounded by $O(|E|)$, which in the worst case of a connected graph is $O(N^2)$\"</u>.\n",
    "4. \"Looking at the required number of iteration<u style=\"color: green\">s</u> depicted in Table. I also dose not provide any insight\".\n",
    "5. \"This suggests the QEMC as a new polynomially-<s style=\"color: red\"> </s>efficient heuristic solver of the Max-Cut problem\".\n",
    "6. <s style=\"color: red\">\"In the QEMC circuit, the number of gates is given by the product of L log N layers with the number of gates per layer, which is of the order of the number of qubit n = log N, giving a total of N log2 N time and N memory to simulate the variational QEMC circuit\".</s><u style=\"color: green\">\"In the QEMC circuit, the number of gates $m$ is the product of the number of layers $L = O(log N)$, with the number of gates per layer, which is $O(log N)$. Therefore, a classical simulation of the circuit has a time complexity of $O(Nlog^2N)$ and a space complexity of $O(N)$\".</u>\n",
    "7. \"Memory<u style=\"color: green\">-</u>wise, one needs to <s style=\"color: red\">store</s> store the graph using E memory\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Table $III$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. QEMC-TIME-quantum cell should be $O(N^2log^2N)$, If indeed we stick to the convention that $S = O(N^2)$ (I still suspect that $S = O(N)$ with some high linear factor)."
